## Fluid Simulation
Based on the framework proposed by Jos Stam in <a href="http://www.intpowertechcorp.com/GDC03.pdf">“Real‐Time Fluid Dynamics for Games”</a>
<br/>Let’s build a fluid simulator! Your job is to create 2D smoke fluid simulation using a grid‐based, Eularian approach. Your velocity field and density field must obey Navior‐Stoke equations, incompressibility, and boundary conditions. The simulator must be interactive and run in real‐time; the user can use a mouse to manipulate velocity and density fields and visualize the smoke evolving in the 2D grid in real‐time.
